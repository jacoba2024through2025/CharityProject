      This charity aims to give students an interest in learning more about
      computer science. Codefund is asking anyone to complete coding challenges
      in the following languages:

      One programming language project completed counts as a donation. For
      example, if someone completes the Python project, one donation will be
      added. 100% of the proceeds from this charity go to underdeveloped schools
      that may not have the ability to fund computer science courses.
